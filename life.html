                    <h6>Missed Developmental Milestones?</h6>
                    <p>Caregivers are undeniably the first expert and strongest advocate for their child with Rett syndrome. A parent typically observes a developmental delay or regression in their child within their first 6-8 months of life, and addresses this with their child’s primary doctor.</p>

                    <h6>Building Rett Knowledge</h6>
                    <p>Curious to know more about their child’s symptoms, caregivers often begin online research to try and uncover a potential diagnosis. They often learn about Rett syndrome and, in this moment, begin their life-long dedication to understanding Rett syndrome, their child’s behaviours, care planning, treatment options and ways of living life with Rett to the fullest.</p>

                    <h6>Rett Diagnosis</h6>
                    <p>Arriving to a clear diagnosis of Rett can be a winding road due to system delays and misdiagnoses (such as autism). Caregivers play a big role in diagnosis by asking for referrals to a specialist or an Early Intervention Program. The caregiver may even suspect Rett syndrome based on their own research. <br> Thankfully, in Canada, genetic testing for Rett is customary once a symptomatic developmental delay is uncovered. A Rett syndrome diagnosis often comes with a wave of mixed emotions for the family – relief, worry, disappointment and concern for the future. If this is you, seek support. This can be a very challenging time. Know that your child with Rett syndrome is sure to lead a remarkable life.</p>

                    <h6>Assembling a care team</h6>
                    <p>
                        Caring for a child with Rett syndrome takes a team approach. However, Rett syndrome is rare and healthcare expertise in Canada on Rett syndrome is unfortunately even rarer. In Canada, caregivers often shoulder the responsibility of locating and coordinating the right experts for their child. Children’s hospitals often play a helpful role in connecting families to medical experts. <br> The care team often features a combination of the following experts, depending on the child’s needs: Pediatric Neurologist, Cardiologist, Speech Pathologist, Gastroenterologist, Developmental Specialist and Physiotherapist. Other experts may also play a role.</p>

                    <h6>Creating a care plan</h6>
                    <p>A care plan evolves with each child’s and family’s needs. Managing symptoms to increase the daily quality of life is a main goal. Planning for future possibilities such as changes in mobility, digestion, breathing and other symptoms is ongoing. <br> Caregivers observe changes to their child most readily and are often experts in knowing when to seek additional medical expertise or changes to the care plan.</p>

                    <h6>Family & Community Support</h6>
                    <p>Like any family, Rett families have social and community ties that enrich their lives and the lives around them. A person with Rett syndrome will often partake in a range of educational and extracurricular activities that include building meaningful relationships with others. Many Rett families find connecting with other Rett families – in real life, or virtually – to be especially rewarding. Community members such as neighbours, teachers, family friends and coaches can also play meaningful roles in supporting a person with Rett syndrome and their family.</p>

                    <h6>Transition & Challenges</h6>
                    <p>A person with Rett syndrome will experience many transitions and changes throughout their life, presenting new challenges and adjustments to routines and care plans. Medically speaking, the symptoms and comorbidities associated with Rett syndrome are likely to change and evolve over time. These periods of change can be daunting and difficult for children and caregivers. Lifestyle changes such as entering a new school might mean helping to educate a new teacher or therapist on Rett syndrome and putting new systems in place to ensure the child is supported and cared for outside of the home. Caregivers typically shoulder great responsibility and exhaustion is common. If this is you, seek help and support from your community and care team. Additionally, please see the Rett Resources available to you.</p>
